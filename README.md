# Email Spam Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify emails into spam and non-spam categories. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the email data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using techniques like TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leovidith/ML-Email-Classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook email_spam_classification.ipynb
   ```
